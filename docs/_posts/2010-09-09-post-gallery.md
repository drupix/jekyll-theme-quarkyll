**These are gallery tests for image wrapped in `<figure>` elements.**

To place a gallery add the necessary YAML Front Matter:

```yaml
# YAML Front Matter
gallery:
  - url: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-1.jpg
    image_path: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-1-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 1"
    title: "Image 1 title caption"
  - url: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-2.jpg
    image_path: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-2-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 2"
    title: "Image 2 title caption"
  - url: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-3.jpg
    image_path: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-3-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 3"
    title: "Image 3 title caption"
  - url: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-4.jpg
    image_path: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-4-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 4"
    title: "Image 4 title caption"
```

And then drop-in the gallery include --- gallery `caption` is optional.

You can have multiple gallery on the same page, each one has is own  [**fancybox**](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/).

If `url` is not specified for one or more images, they will not appear in **fancybox** (example follow later).
{: .notices }

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery with **Markdown support**." %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery with **Markdown support**." %}

This is some text after the gallery just to make sure that everything aligns properly.

## External images

Here comes another gallery, this time set the `id` to match 2nd gallery hash in YAML Front Matter.

```yaml
# YAML Front Matter
gallery2:
  - url: https://source.unsplash.com/1TJTpKXwjy0/1400x934
    image_path: https://source.unsplash.com/1TJTpKXwjy0/180x120
    alt: "Brick Lane Street Art, London"
  - url: https://source.unsplash.com/GUi8uIw3JbQ/1400x1166
    image_path: https://source.unsplash.com/GUi8uIw3JbQ/200x166
    alt: "Model with a Vincent van gogh paint on his face inspire by Sunflowers and van gogh artwork"
  - url: https://source.unsplash.com/z_X0PxmBuIQ/1400x934
    image_path: https://source.unsplash.com/z_X0PxmBuIQ/180x120
    alt: "Catrina´s parade in México City"
  - url: https://source.unsplash.com/SYzUF6XcWBY/850x1100
    image_path: https://source.unsplash.com/SYzUF6XcWBY/170x220
    alt: "A pink flamingo"
  - url: https://source.unsplash.com/9alDwYeAdN4/734x1100
    image_path: https://source.unsplash.com/9alDwYeAdN4/146x220
    alt: "Going Home"
```

And place it like so:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="This is a second gallery example with images hosted externally." %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="This is a second gallery example with images hosted externally." %}

And for giggles one more gallery just to make sure this works.

 Note that these images do not have an `url`. **fancybox is not used for this gallery**.
 {: .notices .warning }

```yaml
# YAML Front Matter
gallery3:
  - image_path: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-2-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 2"
  - image_path: /images/post-gallery/unsplash-gallery-image-4-th.jpg
    alt: "placeholder image 4"
```

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gallery id="gallery3" caption="This is a third gallery example with two images **having no url**." %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include gallery id="gallery3" caption="This is a third gallery example with two images **having no url**." %}

## Gallery column layout

Gallery column layout can be overrided by setting a `layout`.

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include gallery id="gallery4" layout="half" caption="This is a half gallery layout example." %}{% endraw %}
```

{% include gallery id="gallery4" layout="half" caption="This is a half gallery layout example." %}
